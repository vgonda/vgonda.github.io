> An interactive, online presentation about Test-Driven Development. I'll share trivia questions on the topic followed by an explanation of the answers.

>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process where you write failing tests before writing the code to make it pass. If it's not something you're familiar with, it can be hard to learn how to get started with TDD. We’ll go over the basics of testing and TDD, how you can apply it at varying levels of your architecture, and what steps to take if you’re working with legacy code.
