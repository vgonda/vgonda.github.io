I love the work I do as an Android Developer. I enjoy learning about new things, and applying them to my work.

In my work as an engineer, I'm an accessibility advocate, encouraging accessible, inclusive practices at my company and in the design system I help build and maintain. I authored the book _[Android Accessibility by Tutorials](https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/android-accessibility-by-tutorials)_ and have [spoken](talks.md) around the world on the topic.


While studying at [Hope College](https://hope.edu/), I also started getting involved in dance technology and dance production üé≠. I had a couple projects that worked together with a dancer and an Xbox Kinect, and did a significant amount of lighting design. Ask me about them, I love talking about it!

When I‚Äôm not out doing these things, you can find me in my home base in Michigan. In my spare time, I enjoy playing [board games](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeLVaNBlLlz/) with friends, [climbing](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ck4SpkQurf0/), or curled up at home with a good book and [my pets](https://www.instagram.com/p/CkZqgVyOeQP/) üêà ü¶î.
